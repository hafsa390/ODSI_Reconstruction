### Project Objective ###

Reliable visual discrimination of clinical tissue types is a challenging problem because traditional RGB imaging captures information restricted to the human eye's capabilities. Hyperspectral imaging(HSI) can capture abundant visual information using many narrow bands, facilitating tissue differentiation. However, till now, hyperspectral imaging has been successful mainly in massive industrial applications due to the high cost of hyperspectral cameras. In this project, we propose a deep learning-based approach to reconstruct hyperspectral images from corresponding RGB images. We employ the Oral and Dental Spectral Image Database (ODSI-DB), consisting of 316 oral and dental reflectance spectral images, to achieve this. We apply the minimum noise fraction (MNF) dimensionality reduction approach on the ODSI datacubes and consider the top three MNF-generated images as those exhibiting the most informative features. Instead of training the proposed deep learning model with all the spectral images, we utilize the MNF-generated images as groundtruth and reconstruct three images. Evaluation shows that our method can reconstruct three HSIs close to the groundtruths and preserve informative features with high-class separability. 

### Dataset Description ###
